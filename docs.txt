1. Project Scope
Objective: Redesign the existing King Sukh Guest House website to improve aesthetics, user engagement, and responsiveness.

Key Goals:

Modernize the visual design with a clean and welcoming look.

Implement responsive design for seamless experience on all devices.

Include interactive elements like dark mode toggle and smooth navigation.

Maintain brand consistency with logo, colors, and theme.

Responsive navigation with desktop and mobile menu.

Dark mode toggle button.

Hero section with background image and call-to-action button.

Room listings with images and descriptions.

Contact form with validation and submission feedback.

2. Design Decisions
Typeface: Used Google Fonts ‘Inter’ for a modern, readable look.

Color Palette: Light theme with blues and grays, with a complementary dark mode palette using darker backgrounds and lighter text for eye comfort.

Layout:

Fixed header with navigation for easy access.

Grid-based room layout for clear visual hierarchy.

Spacious sections with padding for better readability.

Animations: Added subtle fade-in for hero section and hover effects for interactive elements to enhance user engagement.

Mobile First: Used Tailwind CSS utility classes to ensure a responsive design that adapts to mobile screens and scales up for desktops.

3. Technical Details
Tech Stack:

HTML5 semantic structure.

Tailwind CSS (via CDN) for styling.

Vanilla JavaScript for interactivity (dark mode toggle, mobile menu toggle).

Dark Mode Implementation:

Custom CSS toggling .dark class on the <body> element.

Separate color variables and overrides for dark backgrounds and text.

Performance:

Optimized images via Unsplash source URLs.

Minimal JavaScript for fast loading.

Utilized CDN-delivered CSS for caching benefits.

Accessibility:

Buttons and links with clear labels.

Keyboard-accessible menu toggles.

Responsive layout ensuring usability on all devices.

4. Maintenance & Updates Instructions
Adding Content:

Update room details by editing the room cards in the “Rooms” section.

Modify text in “About” and “Contact” sections directly in index.html.

Styling:

Modify colors, fonts, or spacing in style.css.

Add new Tailwind utility classes in the HTML as needed.

JavaScript:

Keep the dark mode and menu toggle logic inside the <script> block in index.html.

Add new scripts carefully to avoid conflicts.

Deployment:

Host the static files (index.html and style.css) on any web server or platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel.

Backups:

Keep backups of both files regularly to avoid data loss.

Version Control:

Use Git for tracking changes.

Commit descriptive messages when updating design or features.

5. Challenges & Solutions
Dark Mode Compatibility:

Challenge: Tailwind CDN version does not support built-in dark mode toggling.

Solution: Implemented a custom .dark class toggling on the <body> with manual CSS overrides.

Responsive Menu:

Challenge: Making a user-friendly mobile menu toggle.

Solution: Created a simple JavaScript toggle to show/hide menu links on smaller screens.

Performance Optimization:

Challenge: Loading high-res images without slowing the site.

Solution: Used Unsplash source URLs with moderate resolution and background overlay to maintain readability.

Accessibility:

Challenge: Ensuring the website works well for keyboard users.

Solution: Added clear aria-labels on buttons and ensured interactive elements respond to keyboard input.

6. Future Improvements (Optional)
Implement backend form submission for the contact form.

Add multilingual support for wider accessibility.

Integrate booking APIs for real-time reservations.

Add testimonials or review sections.

Use a CSS preprocessor or build system for more scalable styles.
